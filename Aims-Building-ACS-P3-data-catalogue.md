# Building an ACS P3 data catalogue

## Aims

The Climate and Hazard Program (P3) of ACS intends to build a data catalogue with the following aims:

- Make ACS P3 staff more effective by improving the accessibility and clarity of provenance for core internal datasets generated across the institutional partners.
- Help meet requirements for ACS data to comply with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, & Reusable) principles of data management.
- Help meet the recommendations of the 2020 Bushfire Royal Commission ( which have been supported by Government )*

## What will it do and for whom?

The catalogue will initially provide data tools and accompanying tutorial documentation for ACS staff working on Australian NCI resources with Level B: 'shared data' (project ia39), but can offer a template that could be adapted for both Level C: 'public data’ at NCI and other future publicly available data sources.

## Next steps

The next step will be writing a short scoping document for the data catalogue task outlining more detailed requirements and a work plan.  This plan will be informed by the principles that will underpin the ACS data governance framework being developed by the ACS Data Governance Group:

- Principle 1 – Partner agencies remain custodians or stewards of their data and information; and are responsible for governance and data management practices for this information.
- Principle 2 – For information brought together to deliver ACS, a shared approach to information governance and management will be used.
- Principle 3 - Adopt, adapt and where necessary invent.

## Governance

This aims document has the support and approval of the ACS P3 leadership

The 2020 Bushfire Royal Commission recommended *( **Recommendation 4.1** – National disaster risk information & **Recommendation 4.2** – Common information platforms and shared technologies )* that “Australian, state and territory governments should prioritise the implementation of harmonised data governance and national data standards ” and “should create common information platforms and share technologies to enable collaboration in the production, analysis, access, and exchange of information, data and knowledge about climate and disaster risks.”
